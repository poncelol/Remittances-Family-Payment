# Remittances-Family-Payment
RFP is a platform that allows migrants to send money to their families instantly, securely, and without costly intermediaries, using the Open Payments API and the Interledger test wallet. Sending money is as easy as writing a message in a Telegram chat, with sender validation, real-time confirmations, and full traceability of each transaction.
